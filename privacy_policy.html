          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage,
          no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
          your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking
          is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
          about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
          browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or
          legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not
          respond to them at this time.

         <p>To exercise these rights, you can contact us by emailing us at info@acchordion.com.</p>
         <p>Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an
           authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request
           from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been
           validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable laws.
           </p>
        <h5>Request Verification</h5>
        <p>
          Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
          determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
          in our system. We will only use personal information provided in your
          request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
          However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
           maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information
           for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
           fraud-prevention purposes. If you submit the request through an
           authorized agent, we may need to collect additional information to
            verify your identity before processing your request and the agent
            will need to provide a written and signed permission from you to
            submit such request on your behalf.
        </p>
        <h5>Appeals</h5>
        <p>

          taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written
          explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If your appeal is denied,
          you may submit a complaint to your state attorney general.
